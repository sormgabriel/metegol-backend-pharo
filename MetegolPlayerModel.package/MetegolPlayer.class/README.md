Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:

For the Class part:  State a one line summary. For example, "I represent a paragraph of text".

For the Responsibility part: The MetegolPlayer just knows respond its name  and aliases. Ids, it will be treated when It will implemented the database api.

For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them.
